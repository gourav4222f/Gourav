I want to upgrade my portfolio site with new features and a robust tech stack. Here are my requirements:

Reference Inspiration:
Refer to my current portfolio for design/theme inspiration (use the vibe and style, but feel free to improve and modernize). Base all written content (About, Experience, Skills, Projects) on my current resume, which I’ll provide as a file or link.

Stack and Tools:

Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router, no TypeScript, with Tailwind CSS)

UI/UX: Follow best practices for a modern, clean, responsive, and accessible user experience. Use subtle, elegant visual effects (Framer Motion, GSAP, etc.).

Data & Auth:

Implement a dashboard (admin area) to allow me to dynamically add/edit/delete projects and content.

Use NextAuth.js for basic authentication (email/password/social—keep it simple; secure the dashboard).

Store images/assets in the local Next.js /public or /assets folder initially, with the intent to later move to Vercel Blob storage.

Make the site truly dynamic (projects, experience, skills, etc. should come from the database, not static files).

Use Neon as the PostgreSQL database and Prisma ORM for database management.

Folder Structure: Organize everything for scalability and ease of maintenance—components, sections, pages, prisma, utils, hooks, assets, etc.

Deployment: Advise or set up Vercel deployment.

Maintainability & Scalability:

Comment code, add documentation, and ensure any developer can easily extend the project (e.g., add blog, testimonials, dark mode later).

Extras & Suggestions:

Suggest additional improvements, integrations, or UI details if you spot any opportunities for enhancement.

Deliverables:

Complete Next.js 15 (App Router) project following these requirements.

Ready for local dev and Vercel deployment.

Clear instructions for setup, development, and deployment.
